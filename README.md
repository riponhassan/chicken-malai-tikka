Malai tikka or kabab is a soft, juicy and creamy chicken recipe made with cheese, creame and cashew nuts based marination.
Chicken malai tikka also known as murgh malai kebab is a rich kabab of mughlai cuisines. Boneless chicken pieces are marinated in a cheese, cashew and cream based marination with a small amount of yogurt. It has a distinct and rich flavour of elaichi (green cardamom) powder.
This malai tikka is best to make with chicken breast or chicken supreme pieces. Otherwise you can use chicken leg boneless as well. Tikka means boneless chunks of meats and malai for cream so the term chicken malai tikka means creamy boneless chicken.
So you can describe malai kabab as a creamy boneless chunks of chicken perfectly cooked, charred and tendered over a charcoal fire tandoor. Rhis chicken malai tandoori is super creamy in taste and so tender that melt in mouth.
Here is a recipe instruction

Mix them nicely and keep marinated for 15 to 20 minutes.
Soak the cashew nuts for 10 minutes and after that drain and mix with the grated cheese. Grind them into a fine paste using small amount of water.
Take the paste in a mixing bowl. And add curd, green cardamom powder, salt , fresh cream and cooking oil. Give everything a good mix to make malai tikka paste.
Making Chicken malai tikka
Now mix the first marinated chicken pieces with this malai paste nicely so that all parts of them are well coated with the masala.
Keep them refrigerated for 3 to 4 hours to marinate and absorb all flavours.
Preheat an oven to 240Â°C and line a baking tray with aluminum foil.
After that thread the marinated chicken pieces in iron shewer or in wooden sticks ( pre soaked in water for 15 minutes) one by another.
Now place the shewer or wooden sticks over the baking tray and bake for 15 minutes or till the chicken become crisp golden.
While cooking brush some oil or butter after 7 to 8 minutes and rotate the Shewer to cook evenly from all sides.
Similarly you can make chicken malai tikka on tawa or pan. 
I really enjoy to make this Chicken malai tikka, so easy to make and you don't need to have lots of spices. Just salt, cardamom powder and chilli or pepper powder.
